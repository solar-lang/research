I think there is immense value, in being interoperable to go.

- it's a simple language
- lots of libs exist, and we can use the functionality
  -> have working programming language from the get go
- really fast compiler, good for cli
- we get a lot of opinionated machine-code decisions out of the box.

it will be easiest to only do [solar code calling go], not [go code calling solar]
