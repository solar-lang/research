## Interfaces / Traits

let's go with this interface here (pseudo syntax)

    interface ToString
        - fun toString(self): String

Now, of course things like int implement

toString(int).

in Code, we can use this as:

    ToString 7

which in turn looks like this,
autogenerated by the compiler:

    struct ToString {
        data: VoidPtr, // Box<int> in our case.
        toString: Fn<VoidPtr> -> String // wrapper around toString(Int):   Fn(x: Int*) => toString(*x)
    }

what if we don't have ToString(int)?
We can supply our own method. Here we cast an opened file as ToString:

    ToString (fs.open "mytable.csv") toString=readToString
