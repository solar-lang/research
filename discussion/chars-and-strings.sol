# Chars & Strings

# A String can be typed using 'ab' or "ab".
# But if there's just one character,
# it's type is going to be Char.
# Char implements
#
# autoconvert(self) -> String


there are reasons against using autoconvert, which would disallow this as well


# For now: No Char type. Maybe use Stack for small strings
