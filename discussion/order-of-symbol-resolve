# Order of resolve

when searching for the approprite function for myFunc(x)
(where x is an Int)
we search for myFunc in this order:

        v-- actually in whatever package Int is defined
1.)     search in int.sol directory

2.)     search in imports in order of appearance

3.)     search in LocalScope
            -> This way we can locally define "cheap" catch-all solutions
