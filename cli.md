# CLI

would be nice, if we can use solar as a shell

here just come some examples, of how things may look

git :checkout :main

git/checkout "main"

git/checkout :main

git/branch :feat/openapi

sh/ls

sh/mv :home/Scripts :./Scripts

NOTE

I really prefer / for paths, as it's distinct from the `dot` operator
