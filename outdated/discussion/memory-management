I am tryting to create the single best suited langauge for beginners.
While that is an unreachable goal, it's a nice maxima for decisions.

Therefore the language will be garbage collected.

In case someone needs manual memory management (e..g gor c interop) the type system should express this.

Example: Just write `Man` in front of a type to make it non garabage collected.

While this looks exactly like a `type Man T` (which I like) it will behave a little different.
