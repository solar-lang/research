# no tuples

at least not like this: (a, b)

## why?


Generic Notation:

Map (Key, Value)
would be recognozed as Map<(Key, Value, _>
should be recognozed as Map<Key, Value>


## Solution

[1.0, 2.0, 3.0] : [f32; 3] = [f32, f32, f32]
> auto derive `index(usize) -> f32`

["hello", 42] : [String, Int64]
> don't derive `index`
