# don't use the `|` for piping
While it's nice to have it look like a pipe, there are several reasons not to:

- it's not a pipe
- the : operator would feel a little like . (e.g. `player : move x y` is more familiar to `player.move x y`)
- the | operator can be used more 'math-like'. Instead of length(array) one could use |array|. Very nice!
